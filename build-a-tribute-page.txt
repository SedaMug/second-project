          <span>Short explanation of Prophet Muhammed's character:</span>
        </h3>
        <p class="character-1"> 
         Prophet Muhammad was known for his strong character, characterized by honesty, integrity, and trustworthiness, earning him the title "Al-Amin" (the trustworthy) before his prophethood. He was also renowned for his compassion, humility, and perseverance. His simple lifestyle and focus on spiritual matters set an example for Muslims to follow.
        </p>

        <p class="character-1">
          <span><em>Honesty and Integrity:</em></span>
    Even before receiving his divine revelation, Muhammad was known for his honesty and fairness in business and personal dealings. His reputation for trustworthiness was so strong that people entrusted him with valuable possessions, even as they rejected his message. 
        </p>

        <p class="character-1">
          <span><em>Compassion and Humility:</em></span>
Prophet Muhammad showed great compassion towards others, particularly the poor and marginalized. He lived a humble life, content with simplicity and rejecting extravagance.    
        </p>

        <p class="character-1">
          <span><em>Perseverance:</em></span>
He faced significant challenges and persecution in Mecca, yet he remained steadfast in his mission. 
        </p>

        <p class="character-1">
          <span><em>Piety and Spiritual Focus:</em></span>
Muhammad was deeply spiritual, often spending time in prayer and meditation, and he emphasized the importance of faith and worship.   
        </p>

        <p class="character-1">
          <span><em>Example for Muslims:</em></span>
His life and teachings serve as an ideal for Muslims to emulate in their daily lives, striving to embody the virtues he demonstrated.
